Dynamic web application developed for Virtual Observatories - India at IUCAA, Pune during Summer 2012.

Currently the repo has the Eclipse project that can be directly imported to your eclipse.
Unfortunately though, since there is no database backend at the moment, it isn't much use!

A brief idea of how the homepage would look is captured in **homepage.png**

The exact functionalities are elaborated in **Project-Report.pdf**

Browse the nirlib/ folder for the actual source code.

* **nirlib/src/queryPackage/** has the Java Servlets that talk with the backend DB
* **nirlib/WebContent/**  has all the HTML, JavaScript and AJAX code
